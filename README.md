# Ellipses

This is a _learning_ tool to help improve your ellipse drawing skills.

You are given a sample ellipse and you are asked to draw it on the provided canvas (ideally, with an stylus on a tablet). Then you can compare your results with:

* The original ellipse.
* The best fitting ellipse to your drawing.

## Running the app

You can run it locally using

`pipenv run streamlit run ellipses.py`

after having installed all the dependencies using

`pipenv install`
